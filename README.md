goupx - Fix Go ELF executables to work with upx
-----------------------------------------------

Installation: `go get github.com/pwaller/goupx/`

(or if you don't want to do it with root, `GOPATH=${PWD}/env go get github.com/pwaller/goupx/` will install it to `${PWD}/env/bin/goupx`)

Usage: `goupx [filename]`

Fixes the `PT_LOAD` offset of [filename] and then runs `upx`.

This is only necessary for ELF executables (not Mach-O executables, for example).

Based on [code found on the upx bugtracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=102331&aid=3408066&group_id=2331).

    Packed 1 file: 0 ok, 1 error.

Typical compression ratio
=========================

Resulting filesizes are typically 25% of the original go executable. Your mileage my vary.
